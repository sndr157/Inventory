# Project "Superpy" 🚀 

This project engaged advanced Python skills, emphasizing understanding Command Line Interfaces (CLI) 🖥️, independent logic flow design 📈, and incorporation of new Python modules 🐍. The centerpiece of the development was a CLI, enabling seamless user interaction through text-based commands 📜. Translating the project's tea into a functional program was achieved through an independent logic flow design. To enhance the application's functionality and adaptability, we integrated new Python modules. This intricate process of stitching together key programming ingredients made the project both challenging and rewarding, significantly sharpening my technical acuity 🔧💡.

## 📝 Description
# Inventory Management Application 📦💼

Welcome to the **Inventory Management Application!** An amazing, easy-to-use application for managing products, sales, and profits seamlessly! Keep track of your products and sales with our highly efficient and user-friendly system. 🎯🚀

## Key Features 👀 🎉

- **Inventory Management** 📦 : Keep an organized record of what you have in stock with a CSV file called `bought.csv`.
  
- **Sales Record** 💰 : Never lose a detail of a transaction! Sales are recorded diligently in a separate CSV file called `sold.csv`.
  
- **Date-Specific Reports** 📆 : Generate an insightful date-range specific sales report along with the total profit made during that period.
  
- **Inventory Display** 📝 : Easily see what products are available in your inventory, displayed in a well-structured table.
  
- **Expiry Check** ❌ : Get informed about expired products based on their expiration date and the current date mentioned in the `current_date.txt` file.
- 

## How To Use? 💡 🛠️: I refer you to my Run_App.md file for detail information.
 


### Tech Stack 💻 

1. **Python**: This is the primary programming language used to build this application.

2. **Python Libraries**: The application uses several Python libraries including:
   - `csv` for reading and writing to CSV files.
   - `datetime` for handling dates and times.

3. **CSV Files**: This application uses CSV files for storing inventory and sales data, making it an important part of the application's tech stack.

4. **Text Files**: A text file is used to store the current date information.

5. **Terminal/Command line interface (CLI)**: The application is run and interacted with via a terminal or command line interface.

6. **rich library**: This library is used to create better styles and rendering in the console.

7. **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: Visual Studio Code


## 🌟 Features

- **Quantity Management**: This feature allows for selling specific quantities of a product when multiple identical items exist - ultimately facilitating better inventory management 🛍️.
- **Dynamic date format handling**: The system supports various date formats, including 'YYYY-MM' and 'YYYY.' This increases the user interface's adaptability and user-friendliness 📆.
- **Flexible Data Reporting**: The project enables data output using only '--start_date' or '--end_date' instead of both. This encapsulates the essence of user flexibility and convenience while sorting through data 🗂️.
